    <p class="blockquotei">Every year, 200 million Himalaya products enter the homes of consumers around the world. With a range of over 300 healthcare and personal care products including brands like Liv.52, Cystone, and Bonnisan, we touch the lives of millions of customers worldwide, giving them products that help them lead healthier, enriched lives.</p>											
<p>Himalaya's story began way back in 1930. A curious young man riding through the forests of Burma saw restless elephants being fed the root of a plant, <em>Rauwolfia serpentina,</em> which helped pacify them. Fascinated by the plant's effect on elephants, this young man, Mr. M. Manal, the founder of Himalaya, wanted to scientifically test the herb's properties.<br>											
</p>											
<p>With no money and only a pocketful of dreams, he pawned his mother's jewelry to buy a hand-operated tableting machine. The years that followed were a time of endurance and a test of the young man's patience, strength and passion. He spent his days learning about herbs from neighborhood healers and his nights working on the machine to make a few hundred tablets. His vision was to 'bring the traditional Indian science of Ayurveda to society in a contemporary form'.</p>											
<p>In a time when herbal products were regarded with scepticism, our founder's belief in the healing power of herbs was unwavering. He felt that if people were offered safe and effective herbal medicines, they would come to accept them as part of their healthcare routine. He believed that herbal medicines could and should be evaluated on the same quality and efficacy parameters as conventional medicine. This was possible through empirical research. Once scientific research proved that herbal products worked, even doctors could be won over.											
This was a big dream with big challenges. But he persevered on despite the obstacles.</p>											
<p>After four years of researching the herb Rauwolfia serpentina, SerpinaÂ®, the world's first natural antihypertensive drug was launched in 1934.</p>											
<p>The discovery set the future course for Himalaya. It taught us the value of scientific research. It also taught us the importance of patience, passion and perseverance. We have since focused on converting Ayurveda's herbal tradition into a range of proprietary formulations dedicated to healthy living and longevity.</p>

<p></p>With a history spanning eight decades in the area of herbal research, Himalaya shares a close relationship with nature. We are in the business of not only promoting good health but also safeguarding the health of our planet. Ever since our inception, we have taken great care to protect biodiversity, collect herbs in a sustainable way and promote good agricultural practices. <p></p></div><br>											
<p>In 1955, Himalaya introduced Liv. 52, a liver formulation that ensures optimum liver function. The product soon became our flagship brand and a top selling herbal medicine. Other brands soon followed including Cystone, Bonnisan and Rumalaya forte, products that went on to become household names.<br>											
<br>											
In 1999, Himalaya entered the personal care segment under the brand name 'Ayurvedic Concepts'. This was unchartered territory which brought with it new challenges and new opportunities for learning. People around the world were waking up to the benefits of herbal and natural products for their personal care needs. Himalaya had close to seven decades of research experience in herbal medicine and this legacy had helped us understand the world of herbs. The prospect of entering the personal care space was therefore exciting. We wanted to give customers herbal personal care products that were mild, gentle, hard-working and steeped in science! Our guiding philosophy was to develop a range of personal care products rooted in Ayurveda and backed by research, a mainstay of the Himalaya brand. By remaining true to our research ethic, we built credibility for our range of herbal personal care products and gained the trust of our customers.											
A year later, we expanded our portfolio to include animal health products with the objective of caring for the health and well-being of animals.<br><br>											
With our expanding range of products and growth in international markets, Himalaya underwent a rebranding where the entire range was brought under a single umbrella- Himalaya Herbal Healthcare. With the present portfolio of pharmaceuticals, personal care, baby care, well-being and animal health products, Himalaya has evolved into a 'head-to-heel' herbal wellness company.<br><br>											
After close to 80 years, we remain committed to enriching the lives of people who use our products. Himalaya's therapeutic products have brought relief to people suffering from ailments like liver disorders, diabetes to kidney stones and joint disabilities. Our personal care range captures the best in nature and science, giving our customers products that are gentle, effective and safe for long-term use. Our vision is to offer wellness in every home and for the whole family through our herbal healthcare and personal care products.<br><br>											
Today, the Himalaya brand is synonymous with safe and efficacious herbal products. Starting off operations in Dehradun way back in the 1930s, the company later spread its wings to Mumbai and across the country. In 1975, the company set up an advanced manufacturing facility in Makali, Bangalore, India. In 1991, the company relocated its R&amp;D facility to Bangalore.											
</p><p>We operate in over 90 countries, our products are prescribed by 400,000 doctors worldwide, and millions of customers trust us for their health and personal care needs. <strong>Himalaya Global Holdings Ltd. (HGH) is the parent of all Himalaya subsidiaries</strong>.</p>
